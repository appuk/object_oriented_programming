Object Oriented Programming
In my last repository, I was learning Python for Data Analysis.
So I thought why not learn it in Object Oriented Perspective
1. Basic Concepts: In this program, I created basic class and objects 
2. Vacation Package: In this project, I created a vacation planning application where users can book round-trip flights. I covered different types of validation on departure date and return date and also performed testing on them.

In both the projects, I made use of abstract class.
